"At Snapdocs, we are on a mission to enhance the real estate closing process with efficiency and transparency so that lenders can close their loans sooner and home buyers can move into their dream homes quicker. To help us accomplish this goal, we are looking to bring on a Senior Data Scientist to join our small but mighty team of two Data Scientists! The ideal candidate is someone who relishes pouring over messy data to find patterns and train machines to do so with high accuracy and recall. If this sounds exciting, read on...  Snapdocs is an early-stage, rapidly growing company backed by investors like Sequoia, SV Angel, and YCombinator. We're a small team taking on the extensive mortgage market. We're bringing a scalable and sophisticated software to a pillar of the US economy that still relies on fax machines and manila envelopes.  The type of problems we focus on involve workflow, product design, and data. Monolith vs microservices is an ongoing debate. We are working to find a good authentication pattern that allows for people to work across companies in multiple roles (which is trickier than you might think). Domain Driven Design is our guiding light.  As a Senior Data Scientist, you will focus on aggregating and analyzing large datasets to identify behavior trends using statistics, advanced data mining techniques, and build data models to tackle real-world problems. This means helping to develop our training data, building quick prototypes to evaluate signal to noise ratio in the data, and piping them through multiple machine learning models to find the model that can help automate work. The ideal candidate is someone comfortable leading a team through greenfield projects while pouring over heaps of data to find patterns and train machines to do so with high accuracy and recall. You will build models from the ground up while updating existing models (ML and AI) to automate repetitive repeatable tasks. You will analyze data generated as a by-product of manual tasks and build models that can operate on similar or better accuracy than humans. Up for the challenge?  Over the past 5+ years, you have mastered advanced machine learning techniques to experiment with large data sets while building models deployed in production. You have an expertise in one or more programming languages including Python, SQL or R and have used Cloud Platforms, bonus points for AWS. This is a niche role so advanced degrees in quantitative fields like Statistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics are required (PhDs are ideal). Technical leadership and individual contributor hats both fit you well. You can lead from within while guiding the direction for a technical roadmap. We have a small data science team of 2 today so empathy and collaboration are keys to success. Lastly, you are eager to learn! You don’t know every toolset but have proven that with the right problem, a good tutorial, and a healthy appetite for StackOverflow, you’ll figure it out but don’t mind asking simple questions that result in measurable insights if need be.  Colorado applicants: This role pays $140,000 - $175,000 annually plus equity in the company (pay for other locations may vary).  Snapdocs strongly values diversity and drive. We want to work with people of different backgrounds and different paths in life, and we trust our team to make smart decisions. This means we value independent work as well as collaboration.

Upon reopening of volunteer opportunities in our local community, we will organize ways to be part of our community.  About Cloud Agronomics We have all seen the headlines of global corporations launching initiatives to reduce emissions across their value chains. Recently, carbon offsets from farmland have become a frontrunner for nature-based solutions to climate change - and for good reason. As farmland gains significant traction as a carbon sink, it is important to know how much carbon is really in the soil today - and how much there is in 2 years, 4 years, and so on. The way the industry measures soil carbon and crop nutrients today is expensive, laborious, and prone to error because it requires physical sampling campaigns. Using the first commercially viable and scalable technology to quantify carbon stocks in farmland, Cloud Agronomics can detect how much carbon is in the soil and how healthy crops are from the sky. Cloud Agronomics is on a mission to tackle the barriers that are holding back rapid adoption of sustainable food production. With experience in remote sensing, agriculture, finance, and global business operations, our team is full of leaders who are committed to providing AI-powered solutions for agriculture, technology, and the environment all in one. Through cutting-edge machine learning techniques and advanced spectroscopy, our team has built solutions that have seen a number of soil types, crop stages, and atmospheric conditions. Our two solutions, soil carbon and crop nutrient monitoring, give a scaled view of these measurements that are routinely taken on farmland. The goal is to make carbon sequestration and nutrient management on farmland easy and accessible, supporting the environment and rural communities. We are thrilled by the traction we've had to date. Our technology will be operating in the US, Canada, Brazil, and Australia in 2021 - our customers are eager to use the results from our solutions to power land-management decisions and carbon offset verification. Our team is inspired by the growth we have had - we are in multi-year contracts with the world's largest ag retailers and prominent project developers for carbon farming across two continents. Our backers include SineWave Ventures, Alumni Ventures Group, and Collaborative Fund. We sincerely believe that our team is taking part in a historic shift in the way we grow food, respond to climate change, and build resilient communities around the world. We hope you join our team to make an impact on the future of food.  Our Culture Our mission is to bring scale, traceability, and sustainability to the global food supply chain. Our goal is to build an innovative, diverse team that is committed to this mission and demonstrates behaviors that are consistent with our company's core values: passion, curiosity, integrity, and perseverance. We foster an environment that thrives on constructive collaboration in order to solve the problems we face today to create a better tomorrow. We look forward to meeting you!",data scientist
