"TL;DR : Le job en quelques mots Cleyrop est un DataHub en pleine création. Nous sommes au début de l’aventure, l’équipe est en train de s’assembler et on te propose une place centrale dans l’équipe lab R&D , être en charge de la partie Devops. Explorateur mais surtout Doer , tu sais analyser les besoins clients et internes pour anticiper les prob l ématiques , dérisquer et t ’assurer du succès du produit.  L’aventure que tu pourrais rejoindre Nous avons créé Cleyrop début 2021 avec pour objectif de créer le premier DataHub européen. Pourquoi ? Car aujourd’hui, c’est encore trop complexe. Car aujourd’hui, on se tourne vers des acteurs américains qui ne font qu’une partie du chemin. Car aujourd’hui, le pouvoir de la data doit être à la portée de chacun (e). Now what ? Chez Cleyrop , On est convaincus d’un monde où chacun pourrait prendre le contrôle de ses données afin d’en démultiplier l’usage. C’est pourquoi nous avons créé le premier DataHub européen industriel, sécurisé et modulaire qui embarque les meilleures solutions européennes dans une plateforme consistante et prête à déployer. Les enjeux sont importants, les ambitions aussi (CA 2021 3M€ et CA 2022 10M€). On vient de lever 4 Millions en Seed auprès de business angels et de la BPI ce qui nous permet de nous lancer dans ce défi. On attend plus que toi ! Pourquoi ce recrutement ?  Aujourd’hui , on doit à la fois développer notre portail et préparer son intégration avec nos partenaires . Une équipe de développeurs et développeuses s’ attèle déjà à la pa rtie produit, mais l’écosystème Data est tellement vaste et changeant qu’il nous faut une équipe dédiée à la découverte et aux tests des nouvelles solutions, et no uveaux partenaires . Pour mener à bien cette mission, n o us avons besoin d’un (e) aventurier (e) , une personne capable de comprendre les concept s archite c turaux mais surtout de mettre les mains dans le cambouis , tout en menant à bien la phase d’exploration et de “Proof of concept”. Tu travailleras avec notre équipe tech déjà présente dans l’aventure, équipe très diverse et complète avec Arnaud ( Cofounder ) , Gregory (Archi) , Franck (VP Engineering) , Yann (Lead DevOps) , Luis (Lead Dev) .  Ce qui t'attends si tu nous rejoins  Si tu nous rejoins, tes principaux objectifs seront les suivants :  A court terme : Arriver à craque r les problèmes d’intégration actuels pour préparer la première version du produit  Dans les premiers mois, mettre en place les premières intégrations fonctionnelles  Mettre en place des briques pour permettre à l’équipe tech d’accélérer le développement du produit et l'intégration des produits partenaires.  A long terme : M ettre en place un système pour anticiper les besoins d’ intégrations des développeurs / développeuses pour ne pas bloquer mais plutôt faciliter leur quotidien  Être en c apacit é de déployer en continu à la fois chez nos clients et en interne  Avoir mis en place une plateforme agnostique du cloud sous-jacent  ‍ Une journée type sur ce rôle sera ponct u ée de phases de recherches et d’expérimentation suivi de phases de prototypage , d’itération et de développement . Une part importante de la journée pourra être passée à interagir avec nos différents partenaires en externe et nos différentes équipes en interne. Rédiger de la documentation, des process, et être garant de sa bonne application seront aussi des éléme nts importants pour que nos équipes soient plus efficaces . Enfin, évidemment, une partie de la journée sera passée à coder pour construire avec les équipes le premier Datahub européen !  C'est pour toi si : Si ce défi t’attire , voici ce que l’on attend de toi. Les premières compétences sont requises et cruciales mais si tu ne coche s pas les suivantes, ce n’est pas grave.  Les compétences requises sont les suivantes : Une grande curiosité naturelle et une approche agnostique concernant les technologies , cumulée à une capacité à pouvoir évangéliser et vulgariser ton quotidien  Du pragmatisme en arrivant à se concentrer sur ce qui a le plus d’impact ainsi qu’une capacité à gérer plusieurs sujets de front et plusieurs types d’interlocuteurs et d’interlocu trices.  On attend de toi une forte connaissance de l’environnement DevOps dans lequel tu évoluerais depuis au moins 5 ans pour avoir vu pas mal de chose sans forcément t’être spécialisé(e) dans un domaine en particulier . (On parle de Kubernetes , Docker mais aussi Shell, ssh ...)  Et si en plus tu coche s les cases suivantes, tu seras notre candidat(e) idéal :  Tu es passionné (e) par l’univers de la data et tu as envie de nous aider à créer le premier Datahub européen. Plus qu’une mission d’entreprise, nous pensons que c’est nécessaire !  Evidemment, tu maitrises différents langages, différents environnents et le plus tu auras vu, le mieux ça sera (on ne va pas se mentir).  Tu es déjà engagé(e) dans l’écosystème devops et/ou Data et/ou dataops et tu es animé ( e ) par une mission importante d’ évangélisation  Notre process de recrutement Ces compétences et ces expertises seront vérifiées au cours de notre process de recrutement, défini spécialement pour ce job. Le but est de test er le fit de chaque côté. 1/ D’abord un premier entretien avec Léo , notre Head of Talent , pour parler de tes ambitions professionnelles et identifier si ce que tu veux faire convient avec nos besoins et inversement . L’échange portera également sur la culture d’entreprise. 2/ Le second entretien avec Yann , notre devops leader sera un entretien très porté sur les technos, tes expériences précédentes et ce que tu as déjà mis en place mais ça sera surtout l’occasion pour toi de poser toutes tes questions pratiques. 3/ L a troisième et derni ère étape sera avec Arnaud , cofondateur et Franck , VP Engineering, pour parler de problématiques tech plus high level et voir avoir toi les perspectives d’apprentissage et d’évolution sur le poste. Ça sera aussi l’occasion de pousser encore plus ta compréhension de cleyrop .  A n'importe quelle étape, tu pourras appeler un Joker et Lauren, cofondatrice, prendra 30min avec toi pour répondre à tes questions. On fera la même chose si jamais on a un point en particulier que nous souhaitons évaluer.  Une dernière chose, chez Cleyrop , nous sommes engagé (e)s contre les discriminations, quelles qu’elles soient et nous luttons de manière active pour constituer une entreprise la plus diverse possible . Le premier exemple pour cela étant notre volonté explicite d’avoir un mode de travail “ work from anywhere ” ( et non pas de le subir) , cela nous permet notamment de ne pas discriminer à l’embauche sur le lieu de travail / la capacité à déménager ou non. Mais cela nous permet aussi par exemple de pouvoir recruter des personnes qui, comme nous, ont une volonté de concilier du mieux possibles leurs vies personnelles et professionnelles.  N’hésite plus et viens nous rencontrer, Léo t’attend déjà pour le premier entretien !!!",software engineer

"The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity? Ready to improve on Kubernetes? So are we. Come join VMware’s new exciting Modern Applications Business Unit (MAPBU) team, made up of products and services under the Tanzu portfolio to help users build, run, manage, and observe all of their applications and workloads. Our teams build cloud-native observability solutions that give our customers the confidence to achieve their business outcomes on our enterprise-grade Kubernetes platform.  What is the primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for? Working on observability solutions, you’ll be responsible for the performant implementation of technically challenging features that involve a high volume of metrics, logs, and data - such as streaming, analysis, and visualization. You’ll solve technical problems with Go, Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript using Test Driven Development (TDD), pair programming and other extreme programming (XP) methodologies. You’ll create solutions that scale to meet the needs of the world’s biggest enterprises. You’ll work with popular open source technologies (Prometheus, Grafana, Kubernetes), contributing back to the community while leveraging the best of what open source has to offer in our products. On-call rotations are part of most teams, but incidents are exceedingly rare. Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing? Our observability solutions enable our customers to sleep at night knowing their platform is healthy and performant. From day one, you’ll be contributing towards this goal by writing and improving code, working with product, finding ways to make the team more effective, and contributing to architectural decisions. Most new hires take time during the first few months to ramp up and learn about technology, product, and process. People are most successful when they bring a growth mindset and embrace the discomfort that comes from learning new things. Even as you’re learning, you’ll contribute alongside your peers, bringing your unique experiences to our technical and product architecture conversations. You’ll also mentor your peers, using both past and new experiences to help those around you learn and grow.  What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? Your primary responsibility will be to pair with other engineers on technical problems using Test Driven Development, as well as collaborating more broadly on technical architecture decisions and working with the product team to ensure that we deliver the right solution to our customers. We take pride in writing high-quality, well-tested code. We take ownership of code as a team. We have a general framework for our workday, and we spend most days pairing. We keep meetings and distractions to a minimum, allowing you to focus on writing software and delivering customer value. Office-wide stand-up to build office cohesion and start the day together. Team standup - discuss any blockers, choose pairs, maybe even tell a joke. Start pairing, grab the next item from the backlog, and begin test driving your solution Lunch! Eat on the balcony, run an errand, or join a book club. Reconnect with your pair and start an acceptance test for a big feature. While that schedule does look busy, don’t worry — we take ample breaks throughout the day. Go for a walk by the river, read a book on the balcony, check in with kids’ school day. We also allocate only 7 core hours for pairing, giving you the flexibility to spend time learning new skills, reading email and slack, or catching up on your favorite technical blog. We value sustainable pace. We know there is a life outside of work, we want you to be able to spend time with family and friends. We understand that attending ballet recitals is more important than building great software. While the majority of the team is located in Denver, right now we’re all completely remote and remote teamwork is increasingly important to us. To facilitate pairing, we expect folks to work within flexible core hours based on US Mountain Time. We use Slack to stay connected and shared workspaces for pairing. We are working hard to make sure that our distributed teams function as smoothly as our distributed systems. Developers are rarely alone; from pairing all day to weekly 1 on 1 time with managers, there is always a colleague around to lend a helping hand. Mentorship from senior engineering leadership is built right into our processes. What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like? Inclusion, autonomy, effective processes, sustainability, and employee growth guide our team. We firmly believe in the concept of servant leadership; our job as leaders is to enable others to make informed decisions and do their best work. Leadership is committed to strong feedback practices, with a focus on receiving and giving constructive criticism kindly. We value diversity and strive for an inclusive team. Our leadership growth processes emphasize giving opportunities for people from a variety of backgrounds. We also strive to create an inclusive environment through the language we use. We recognize that the work here is never done. Agile/XP concepts are at the core of our process. We have a host of practices around Test Driven Development, pair programming, team retrospectives, technical retrospectives and continuous integration. We are excited to teach these to you and innovate with you on their implementation. A sustainable pace is key to success, so we aim to never work more than 8 hours a day. We have flexibility during the day and for start and end times, with extra care to be flexible during the difficult times in which we find ourselves. Making an investment in each employee’s professional development improves the organization as a whole. We encourage all employees to attend (virtual!) conferences or purchase those pricey O'Reilly books — we give each person an annual budget to do it.

Below are some highlights, or you can view the complete benefits package by visiting https://benefits.vmware.com/document-library/new-hire-benefits/.
