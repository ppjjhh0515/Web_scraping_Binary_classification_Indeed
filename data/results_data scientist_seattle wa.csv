We are pushing the technical envelope in NL and AI by responding conversationally to images or videos, learning how to bridge the gap between structured data and NL text, and teaching computers to respond to real-world signals through both language and action. Our goal is to design and deploy systems that learn multi-modal interaction strategies from large volumes of language-grounded data.  #Research Responsibilities This is a rewarding role for someone who enjoys working with language and languages (and may know a few), is willing to look at raw data, and is eager to stay abreast of modern techniques in statistics and artificial intelligence. You will be working alongside researchers and product developers on projects that will set the scene for the next generation of natural language processing techniques and applications. In this capacity, you will develop datasets, data processing pipelines, statistical data analyses, and data documentation for research projects and collaborations with product groups. Many of the datasets you work with will be very large and very noisy in their raw state, and you will need to come up with innovative methods to create datasets that will be useful and useable. You will also work with vendors and crowdsourced workers to annotate or create new datasets. You will help define evaluation tasks and scenarios, experiments, standards, metrics and methods for research projects and product groups, and conduct many of the experiments. This is a role that calls for a broad understanding of and sensitivity to situated language use, language varieties including social and regional dialects, text styles, and the many ways in which people interact with one another using language. An important component of your work will be to help ensure that data, models, and products meet Microsoft’s standards of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Together with other members of the team, you will also contribute to elevating awareness of advances in natural language processing in the scientific community and beyond through presentations, publications, and other outlets (e.g., blogs, press interviews). We are looking for candidates who are smart and creative, but are also self-driven, curious, and comfortable exploring open ended problems. Our projects are team efforts and the ability to communicate well with team members and outside collaborators will be key to success. Qualifications REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS: 2+ years of programming experience outside of college coursework in an industrial or research environment. Proficiency in statistical data analysis and visualization using, e.g., R or Python statistical analysis tools. Proficiency in C/C++/C#, Java or similar, and in Python.

We are pushing the technical envelope in NL and AI by responding conversationally to images or videos, learning how to bridge the gap between structured data and NL text, and teaching computers to respond to real-world signals through both language and action. Our goal is to design and deploy systems that learn multi-modal interaction strategies from large volumes of language-grounded data.  #Research Responsibilities This is a rewarding role for someone who enjoys working with language and languages (and may know a few), is willing to look at raw data, and is eager to stay abreast of modern techniques in statistics and artificial intelligence. You will be working alongside researchers and product developers on projects that will set the scene for the next generation of natural language processing techniques and applications. In this capacity, you will develop datasets, data processing pipelines, statistical data analyses, and data documentation for research projects and collaborations with product groups. Many of the datasets you work with will be very large and very noisy in their raw state, and you will need to come up with innovative methods to create datasets that will be useful and useable. You will also work with vendors and crowdsourced workers to annotate or create new datasets. You will help define evaluation tasks and scenarios, experiments, standards, metrics and methods for research projects and product groups, and conduct many of the experiments. This is a role that calls for a broad understanding of and sensitivity to situated language use, language varieties including social and regional dialects, text styles, and the many ways in which people interact with one another using language.

We are pushing the technical envelope in NL and AI by responding conversationally to images or videos, learning how to bridge the gap between structured data and NL text, and teaching computers to respond to real-world signals through both language and action. Our goal is to design and deploy systems that learn multi-modal interaction strategies from large volumes of language-grounded data.  #Research Responsibilities This is a rewarding role for someone who enjoys working with language and languages (and may know a few), is willing to look at raw data, and is eager to stay abreast of modern techniques in statistics and artificial intelligence. You will be working alongside researchers and product developers on projects that will set the scene for the next generation of natural language processing techniques and applications. In this capacity, you will develop datasets, data processing pipelines, statistical data analyses, and data documentation for research projects and collaborations with product groups. Many of the datasets you work with will be very large and very noisy in their raw state, and you will need to come up with innovative methods to create datasets that will be useful and useable. You will also work with vendors and crowdsourced workers to annotate or create new datasets. You will help define evaluation tasks and scenarios, experiments, standards, metrics and methods for research projects and product groups, and conduct many of the experiments. This is a role that calls for a broad understanding of and sensitivity to situated language use, language varieties including social and regional dialects, text styles, and the many ways in which people interact with one another using language.
