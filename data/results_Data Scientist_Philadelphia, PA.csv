Describes a strategy for quantitatively integrating the outcomes of each experiment on the thread to update probability of success and to illustrate risk discharge. Identifies sources of uncertainty, influential/strong assumptions and limitations in current knowledge about the thread. Suggests strategies and options for discharging uncertainties, testing assumptions, and filling in knowledge gaps.

This role will provide YOU the opportunity to lead key activities to progress YOUR career. The responsibilities for Lead Statistician include some of the following: Work with partners in Clinical Pharmacology, Biology and Discovery Medicine to integrate all relevant sources of data (PK, biology, physiology, disease/safety PD) into quantitative models that predict outcomes in humans at both the population level and the specific study design level. Ensure the statistical robustness of prediction models (whose outputs are used to define asset progression decisions) such that all relevant uncertainty is correctly propagated through such models in order to inform the estimate of risk-discharge for any particular development plan option. In particular, to ensure that FTIH study designs and progression decision-making checkpoints accurately reflect this translation modelling progress and that consequently there are clear and defensible decision rules for asset progression at C2FTIH and C2Dev based on the Three Pillars and Quantitative Decision-Making framework. TS statistician and clinical statistician will communicate frequently, work closely to ensure no overlap in roles, and no confusion within the Early Development Team (EDT). TS statistician is accountable for statistical activities up to C2FTIH and will fully transfer accountability at that milestone.

Contribute to optimization of early clinical development strategies and alignment with early medicine profile to inform appropriate development decisions. As early as possible in the asset’s journey Characterise, for the priority indication(s) of the asset, the “golden thread” of experiments, endpoints and observed effect sizes that form a pathway from its current position to a successful registration. Describes a strategy for quantitatively integrating the outcomes of each experiment on the thread to update probability of success and to illustrate risk discharge. Identifies sources of uncertainty, influential/strong assumptions and limitations in current knowledge about the thread. Suggests strategies and options for discharging uncertainties, testing assumptions, and filling in knowledge gaps. Describes what aspects of the “golden thread” are amenable to modelling, what could be investigated (in both resource constrained / unconstrained scenarios), and what is never likely to be attainable/predictable without performing large/long clinical trials.

The responsibilities for Lead Statistician include some of the following: Work with partners in Clinical Pharmacology, Biology and Discovery Medicine to integrate all relevant sources of data (PK, biology, physiology, disease/safety PD) into quantitative models that predict outcomes in humans at both the population level and the specific study design level. Ensure the statistical robustness of prediction models (whose outputs are used to define asset progression decisions) such that all relevant uncertainty is correctly propagated through such models in order to inform the estimate of risk-discharge for any particular development plan option. In particular, to ensure that FTIH study designs and progression decision-making checkpoints accurately reflect this translation modelling progress and that consequently there are clear and defensible decision rules for asset progression at C2FTIH and C2Dev based on the Three Pillars and Quantitative Decision-Making framework. TS statistician and clinical statistician will communicate frequently, work closely to ensure no overlap in roles, and no confusion within the Early Development Team (EDT). TS statistician is accountable for statistical activities up to C2FTIH and will fully transfer accountability at that milestone. Effectively contribute to and defend the asset plans presented at various internal governance boards such as GSB, RRB, RIB, CPEM PRF and CPEM matrix, at meetings with regulatory authorities, external partners and external key opinion leaders. Development of novel quantitative models to build predictive relationship among variables. Contribute to optimization of early clinical development strategies and alignment with early medicine profile to inform appropriate development decisions. As early as possible in the asset’s journey Characterise, for the priority indication(s) of the asset, the “golden thread” of experiments, endpoints and observed effect sizes that form a pathway from its current position to a successful registration. Describes a strategy for quantitatively integrating the outcomes of each experiment on the thread to update probability of success and to illustrate risk discharge. Identifies sources of uncertainty, influential/strong assumptions and limitations in current knowledge about the thread. Suggests strategies and options for discharging uncertainties, testing assumptions, and filling in knowledge gaps. Describes what aspects of the “golden thread” are amenable to modelling, what could be investigated (in both resource constrained / unconstrained scenarios), and what is never likely to be attainable/predictable without performing large/long clinical trials.
