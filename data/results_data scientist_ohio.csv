Job Title: Postdoctoral Fellow on Race and Responsible Data Science Department: Research | Translational Data Analytics Application Deadline June 15, 2021 We invite applications for a postdoctoral fellow based at the Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI). The postdoctoral fellow is expected to have expertise on how data analytics exacerbate racial discrimination and inequity, erode individual agency and democratic power, and influences economics and public policy. The fellow will contribute to the program on Responsible and Just Data Science at TDAI.  The postdoctoral fellowship position offers an exciting opportunity to participate in scholarly discussion and exchange that brings together the data science, and racial and ethnic justice scholarly communities at OSU. The recruiting team is committed to studying data analytics’ dependence on and impact of racial and gender inequalities in society; to engaging with ongoing discussions of data analytics in terms of responsibility, public interest, and ethics; and to investigating the manipulation of data based on prevailing world views and public policies. The community of practice includes scholars from Political Science, Anthropology, Philosophy, Linguistics, Geography, Law, Computer Science, and Integrated Systems Engineering, and we welcome applications from scholars from all of these disciplines and others in the humanities, social sciences, and engineering sciences whose scholarship is focused on understanding the operation of data analytics in relation to racial and gender inequality and other forms of social and political inequality.  The postdoctoral fellow will be mentored and supported in future career goals and will have access to an interdisciplinary mentoring team with expertise on the social, political, ethical and technical dimensions of data science, as well as to a group of stakeholders working towards justice in data sciences. This community is committed to innovate to make the informal connections and research conversations that are part of the process of mentoring work continue smoothly in the new paradigm of virtual programming and communication. Additionally, the postdoc will be integrated in the 2021-2022 cohort of Presidential Postdoctoral Fellows, where they will find a community of peers and other resources available to the members of this program. Required: We seek applicants with a Ph.D. in the social sciences, humanities, or engineering sciences who have substantive training or expertise in understanding political, societal, and ethical dimensions of data science, and who are enthusiastic to work with an interdisciplinary group to develop curriculum in this area. Their primary focus must be based on race/ethnicity. They need not have a computer science background themselves, though of course an understanding of the area as it pertains to their own research is welcome.
