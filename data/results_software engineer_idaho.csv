"Quality & Release Software Engineer * LabStats is searching for a software engineer to kick off a new initiative within the engineering organization with the responsibility for quality and release automation. We build a software-as-a-service analytics platform and are looking to take it to the next level. We’re looking for someone to help us raise the quality of our engineering work—and thus the user experience in our products—while enabling the release of that work to happen with no human effort. We hope you’ll join us on this journey! * * This position requires you to work in the Idaho Falls office. No remote or contract options. No visa sponsorship available. * * What You Will Do Increase the Test Automation Footprint. We have APIs, web apps, desktop apps, and mobile apps. They run on Windows, macOS, on-premises and in the cloud. You’ll strategically build out our test automation to cover them all by writing unit tests, automated UI tests, and other integration tests. This work will increase the confidence and quality we have in our existing products. Improve the Quality of New Features & Products. You’ll partner with Dev and Product on all projects, playing an integral role in ensuring that new features and products are built with production quality from day one, ensuring they can be released continuously as soon as value is created. Optimize the Release Pipeline. We deploy once or twice a week, but it’s not as often as we’d like. You’ll help us get the entire release pipeline automated so we can deploy all day, every day. This is the missing ingredient for us to fully leverage continuous delivery and a lean product development approach. Kick off New Types of Testing. You’ll help us scrutinize our software even more by exploring load testing, performance testing, vulnerability testing, and more. Build the Tools to Make it All Possible. We love solving our own problems with software. As a software engineer you will lead in building the tools needed to realize the quality and release vision. Our Stack & Tools We build and manage web applications, mobile apps, APIs, and background services for Windows and macOS platforms. We hope to get on Linux as well. Most of our code runs in the Microsoft Azure cloud in data centers around the world. On the backend, we use C# and SQL with ASP.NET MVC and fairly vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the frontend. We’re also using a little bit of Objective-C. We use Visual Studio, Git, and Azure DevOps in a Windows environment. Occasionally we switch over to a macOS environment. We currently test with Selenium and MSTest. Life at LabStats We own the SDLC and the develop/ship pipeline. When we don’t like it, we change it. We automate everything we can. Builds, testing, deployments. We have a continuous delivery approach, so we’re ready to build, fix, and ship at any time. We aren’t deadline driven. We’re quality and experience driven. We’re a small team, so everyone is deeply involved in critical work for our business. We have a wide variety of software so we don’t get bored with the same old. We’re disciplined. We have a high bar for quality, professionalism, and attitude. But we have fun and we bend the rules. We collaborate, work, and succeed as a team. Requirements: Our requirements are simple: we want someone who lives our core values.
