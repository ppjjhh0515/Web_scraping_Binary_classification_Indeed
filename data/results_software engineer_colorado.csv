We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart. Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference? Come and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally. About the Role: Our Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients. We have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few. Senior Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them. Who We Are Looking For: You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing. You understand engineering fundamentals. At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. You are a broadly skilled engineer , accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers. You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. You work with confidence and without ego. Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked. What We Care About: What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.

"Software Analyst Apprenticeship Overview Summary Apprenticeship includes two phases: RTI (required technical instruction) and OJT (on-the-job training). RTI prepares apprentices to work productively during OJT. On the job, a software analyst is tasked with maintaining, testing, and updating software products under the supervision of experienced developers, engineers and architects. This role provides more flexibility through a shorter and more focused RTI phase to allow for markets or positions with a lower required experience level, or where specialized training will be a major component of OJT (e.g., embedded systems, cloud services, machine learning), or as a stepping stone to a project or program management career path. Although the apprenticeship will focus on coding, the majority of a software developer’s time is generally not spent writing new applications, especially at the junior level. Instead the focus is on improving existing products and applications by adding features, finding and eliminating bugs, and improving efficiency. Related occupational roles include software developers (a more in-depth version of this role with additional focus on security, distributed systems, and design patterns) and DevOps specialists/network operations developers (who configure the build, test, and deployment environments for developers). RTI Preparation Apprentices generally receive instruction in web fundamentals (2 weeks), JavaScript/Python programming (4 weeks), and additional training in Python, C#, or Java software development (6-8 weeks). This varies by location, training provider availability, and employer requests. A sample training plan follows at the end of this document. We cannot guarantee availability or timing of this exact plan in all markets. Apprentices in this role will not earn certifications, but instead will be evaluated based on the quality of their code submissions or general productivity, as established by the employer. OJT Activities Software analysts generally work on tasks substantially similar to the following during OJT. The exact weight and distribution of these tasks varies by employer and may change over the course of OJT as the apprentice becomes more proficient with advanced tasks. Project Definition o Identify and capture stakeholder requirements using customer interviews and surveys. o Build multiple use cases to describe each action that a user will take in the new system. o Understand and contribute to requirement specification documents. Software Design o Work with stakeholders to understand requirements. o Specify and scope hardware and system requirements. o Identify and mitigate security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise from interactions with other systems, external and legacy code. Development and Implementation o Develop and write software code. o Perform unit testing and fix errors or bugs. Software Testing o Work with development team to create test plans. o Implement test cases. o Find and fix bugs. Deployment and Maintenance o Perform training for end users. o Evaluate and fix bugs that may become apparent after product deployment. Job Type: Full-time COVID-19 considerations: Related Technical Instruction will be remote prior to on-the-job onboarding",software engineer

We’re excited to launch FOLD to find and develop future Fool leaders.  Is this SWE Development Program right for me? The Fool believes this program will be best suited for software engineers with roughly 0-2 years experience. We say “zero” because we understand that many engineers get their start in many different ways. Some started by tinkering with their family computer as a young child, some go to school for computer science, some switch careers and enroll in a boot camp, and others take on the tech in their current role as a “side job”. All of these descriptions are fitting of one or more thriving and excelling engineers at the Fool and we think it likely describes many of our future engineers.  What happens after the structured 6 month program ends? At the end of the 6 month program, we will extend full-time offers to the engineers who have demonstrated the coding skills necessary to contribute to our current SWE teams, as well as other key attributes that make successful, long-term Fools: adaptable, communicative, collaborative and competitive spirit, honest, innovative, and who aren’t afraid to have fun amidst all of our hard work. While our earnest hope is to extend offers to all of our FOLD participants, we may find at any point during this program that this isn’t a good match- for you, for us, or for both. Our promise to you: we will give you honest feedback at every step so you know where you stand, and whether you continue with The Motley Fool or not, you will have been given access to a SWE curriculum and SWE mentorship that will be valuable no matter where you land.  Are FOLD participants paid while going through the program?  Yes! This is a full-time commitment, so throughout the entire duration of your program, you'll receive a competitive salary and be eligible for our world-class benefits.",software engineer

"The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity? Ready to improve on Kubernetes? So are we. Come join VMware’s new exciting Modern Applications Business Unit (MAPBU) team, made up of products and services under the Tanzu portfolio to help users build, run, manage, and observe all of their applications and workloads. Our teams build cloud-native observability solutions that give our customers the confidence to achieve their business outcomes on our enterprise-grade Kubernetes platform.  What is the primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for? Working on observability solutions, you’ll be responsible for the performant implementation of technically challenging features that involve a high volume of metrics, logs, and data - such as streaming, analysis, and visualization. You’ll solve technical problems with Go, Java, Kotlin, and JavaScript using Test Driven Development (TDD), pair programming and other extreme programming (XP) methodologies. You’ll create solutions that scale to meet the needs of the world’s biggest enterprises. You’ll work with popular open source technologies (Prometheus, Grafana, Kubernetes), contributing back to the community while leveraging the best of what open source has to offer in our products. On-call rotations are part of most teams, but incidents are exceedingly rare. Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing? Our observability solutions enable our customers to sleep at night knowing their platform is healthy and performant. From day one, you’ll be contributing towards this goal by writing and improving code, working with product, finding ways to make the team more effective, and contributing to architectural decisions. Most new hires take time during the first few months to ramp up and learn about technology, product, and process. People are most successful when they bring a growth mindset and embrace the discomfort that comes from learning new things. Even as you’re learning, you’ll contribute alongside your peers, bringing your unique experiences to our technical and product architecture conversations. You’ll also mentor your peers, using both past and new experiences to help those around you learn and grow.  What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? Your primary responsibility will be to pair with other engineers on technical problems using Test Driven Development, as well as collaborating more broadly on technical architecture decisions and working with the product team to ensure that we deliver the right solution to our customers. We take pride in writing high-quality, well-tested code. We take ownership of code as a team. We have a general framework for our workday, and we spend most days pairing. We keep meetings and distractions to a minimum, allowing you to focus on writing software and delivering customer value. Office-wide stand-up to build office cohesion and start the day together. Team standup - discuss any blockers, choose pairs, maybe even tell a joke. Start pairing, grab the next item from the backlog, and begin test driving your solution Lunch! Eat on the balcony, run an errand, or join a book club. Reconnect with your pair and start an acceptance test for a big feature. While that schedule does look busy, don’t worry — we take ample breaks throughout the day. Go for a walk by the river, read a book on the balcony, check in with kids’ school day. We also allocate only 7 core hours for pairing, giving you the flexibility to spend time learning new skills, reading email and slack, or catching up on your favorite technical blog. We value sustainable pace. We know there is a life outside of work, we want you to be able to spend time with family and friends. We understand that attending ballet recitals is more important than building great software. While the majority of the team is located in Denver, right now we’re all completely remote and remote teamwork is increasingly important to us. To facilitate pairing, we expect folks to work within flexible core hours based on US Mountain Time. We use Slack to stay connected and shared workspaces for pairing. We are working hard to make sure that our distributed teams function as smoothly as our distributed systems. Developers are rarely alone; from pairing all day to weekly 1 on 1 time with managers, there is always a colleague around to lend a helping hand. Mentorship from senior engineering leadership is built right into our processes. What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like? Inclusion, autonomy, effective processes, sustainability, and employee growth guide our team. We firmly believe in the concept of servant leadership; our job as leaders is to enable others to make informed decisions and do their best work. Leadership is committed to strong feedback practices, with a focus on receiving and giving constructive criticism kindly. We value diversity and strive for an inclusive team. Our leadership growth processes emphasize giving opportunities for people from a variety of backgrounds. We also strive to create an inclusive environment through the language we use. We recognize that the work here is never done. Agile/XP concepts are at the core of our process. We have a host of practices around Test Driven Development, pair programming, team retrospectives, technical retrospectives and continuous integration. We are excited to teach these to you and innovate with you on their implementation. A sustainable pace is key to success, so we aim to never work more than 8 hours a day. We have flexibility during the day and for start and end times, with extra care to be flexible during the difficult times in which we find ourselves. Making an investment in each employee’s professional development improves the organization as a whole. We encourage all employees to attend (virtual!) conferences or purchase those pricey O'Reilly books — we give each person an annual budget to do it.

"Get to know Highwing. Commercial insurance has trouble using its data, limiting its ability to compete effectively and grow profitably. Highwing helps insurance move faster and go further. Insurance is built from millions of individualized data points about customers, claims, costs, and more. Without these data points, calculating and transferring risk at scale wouldn't be possible. The problem is that data is highly fragmented. Rather than businesses being buoyed by this data, they are drowning in it because there are no easy, reliable connections between systems. Highwing is the first open data platform for Insurance brokers and carriers. Think of us as the digital nervous system for Insurance. We connect data both inside and outside our platform in order to bring efficiency to the procurement of insurance. What's it like to work at Highwing? Our Crew. Our team is composed of experienced designers, engineers and entrepreneurs. We believe software development is a team sport, and the best products are built by teams with diverse backgrounds who are empowered with a high degree of autonomy. We strive for rapid iteration and continuous improvement in both our products themselves and our approaches to building them. We work at a sustainable pace and know from experience that building a lasting product organization is a marathon, not a sprint. About the role: Highwing is rapidly growing its product & engineering team to support our customer growth and continue developing our commercial insurance transaction platform. We're looking to expand our frontend team to tackle more insurance space challenges, particularly around workflows and collaboration in data-intensive environments. We're looking for a thoughtful frontend engineer interested in digging into complex workflow challenges and working collaboratively with other functions (product, design, API, data, and customer success) to build product experiences that positively impact the day-to-day work of our end users. About you: You're an experienced frontend software engineer with a track record building design-forward web-based software products with an eye towards usability and maintainability for the long term. You have built user interfaces from the ground up, implementing reusable components and design systems to manage complexity, working in various frameworks and tools, and making the appropriate trade-offs to fit the needs of a particular problem. You relish working closely with design and product teams to scope and deliver the experience that best serves real users' needs. You have worked with products over multiple releases and developed a sense of what it means to build software for long-term maintainability. You are passionate about your work but recognize that building software is a long-term team sport, not an individual sprint. You love well-thought-out architecture, maintainable code, and seamless user experiences and are looking to help build a product that will be a crucial part of many users' daily work lives. Our Stack We are building a greenfield product on a modern technology stack, which currently includes TypeScript/React/Apollo/Storybook (frontend), Ruby/Rails (API), Python/Pandas/Airflow (data), Elasticsearch, Postgres, and several serverless technologies (AWS Lambda/Step Functions). We're not technology zealots, and our team members have a high degree of autonomy to choose the tools they feel best address the challenges at hand. We iterate quickly and deploy continuously while striving to keep the quality of our user experience high and our codebases tidy. And we have a lot of fun doing it, together. Your Work at Highwing You will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining software to support Highwing's product objectives and business goals. You should be comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with quick changes and a high degree of uncertainty. Proficiency in tools and architectures for building modern web user interfaces is a must, as is a desire to learn quickly to adapt to changing technologies and business challenges. As a member of the engineering team, you will help guide both the technical and usability aspects of the software we build and will be involved in all stages of the cycle of iterative product development. You'll work with partners and stakeholders to gather input and prioritize features with designers to establish user flows and look and feel, with other engineers to implement functionality, and with customers to provide support and gather feedback. You will have a high degree of freedom to pick the tools and frameworks that you feel best address the problems at hand and will be responsible for managing and maintaining those technology investments over their entire lifetime. Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities: You are design-centered: having a high degree of product sense & a strong appreciation for UX You are excited to explore new technologies and platforms Bachelor's degree, or related field or equivalent experience Compensation $75 - 90K / year (DOE) At this time, we can only consider United States-based applicants with authorization to work in the United States on a permanent, full-time basis; unfortunately, we cannot provide visa sponsorship or remote employment outside of the United States. Our Core Values Collaboration. We are playing a team sport. Building a successful enterprise is a team effort. But it is important to distinguish a team dynamic from a family dynamic. Teams thrive on unwavering support, respect and openness – but not unconditional acceptance. Talented jerks have no place on a great team. We consistently challenge each other to improve every day – not only with respect, but with uncommon positivity. Autonomy. This is not a little kid's soccer team. We believe extreme autonomy is valuable in not only maintaining happy, productive people, but also in building impactful, innovative products. So we don't all swarm to the ball. We hire intelligent, diligent, passionate people who are capable of operating in large, sometimes ambiguous problem spaces with a great deal of freedom and decision-making authority. In exchange, we expect everyone to dig in, learn deeply about the space and take initiative every day. Improvement. ""Kaizen"" is part of our everyday vocabulary. Our technology, our industry and our clients are always in a constant state of flux. We must regularly evolve with them, or we will quickly fall behind. That's why we are dedicated to practicing ""Kaizen,"" the Japanese concept of continuous improvement. This means we are, above all, a learning culture. We approach every problem with a beginner's mind. We look to improve every part of what we do, every day – from our product to our process and beyond. We always strive to give and receive feedback, even when it is difficult. And we allocate time specifically for learning and reflection, so we can avoid our failures and replicate our successes. Transparency. Having stake in the business is about more than just equity. We believe the best way to give people stake in the business is to give them full visibility into it. That's why we share everything transparently, from ongoing client meetings and project statuses to project financials. This allows everyone to see the work they're doing and understand how that work ladders up, connects and impacts the business. This complete context enables better collaboration, more autonomy and faster improvement. Empowerment. We believe in leading from behind. We believe great managers should act as resources, not gatekeepers. We keep organizational hierarchy minimal, and use it only as a way to help people achieve their maximum potential. This semi ""flat"" culture allows anyone in the organization to not only bring radical ideas to the table, but also to pursue them fully, without bureaucratic barriers in the way. Kindness. Challenge directly, care personally. Kindness doesn't simply mean being nice. And doesn't mean avoiding constructive conflict. Kindness to us means challenging ideas with positive intent. It means being intentional, honest and generous with the way we treat one another, our partners, our clients and the world. We are hell bent on building an uncommonly positive and forthright culture, because we believe this form of kindness has the power to transform our work, our business and our industry. Highwing Benefits Overview Comprehensive insurance: We provide comprehensive employee and family health insurance and ancillary benefits (life insurance, disability, and more). Learning & development stipend: We believe in continuous improvement (see above) - this includes you as a person and as a professional. That's why we provide an annual learning and development stipend that you can use however you see fit to further develop as a professional in your area of expertise or the insurance industry as a whole. Attend conferences, read books, take online learning courses, and more! Time-off to recharge: We have a generous paid time off policy - take what you need when you need it. And when we say time-off - we really mean time-off - don't check your emails, don't reply to Slack - relax and recharge. Remote work: We've created an environment that supports remote work. While we love collaborating with everyone in the office at the same time (and the impromptu happy hours and lunch chats that ensue) - we understand that you may sometimes be more productive at home or in a different environment. We've built our team meetings and processes to support you to work your best wherever you see fit whenever you see fit.",software engineer

You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done"". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate.

What We Care About: What and how you can contribute is what’s important to us. Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. Our culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.

Working with over 90 of the world’s leading electric and gas utilities, Uplight provides an end-to-end customer energy experience. We are B Corp certified, enabling us to put our values into action by not only making decisions for the benefit of our shareholders, but also for our customers, environment, employees, and community. What you get to do: This is a software engineering position on the team designing and building the new API platform that drives our products. The project you’ll be working on is critical to the future of the business and used extensively by both internal teams and external customers, so this is a great opportunity to grow technically and have a huge impact on a mission-driven company. At a high level you will: Shape the engineering future of the company by contributing to architectural decisions for the overall platform strategy. Design and deliver high-quality, well tested, scalable backend software systems. Own features and lead the technical specification process for those features by making and documenting technical decisions and accounting for edge cases. Automate as much as possible – as the API team we’re big believers in well-defined interfaces and building pipelines that ensure our code does what it’s supposed to today and continues to do so tomorrow. Provide mentorship and guidance to junior team members. On the technical side, you’ll have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge cloud architectures and help scale our data driven platform. This is a growing team, meaning you will help define the culture and processes with us as we build out the team together, but as a start, here are some values that are important to us: Work life balance – We take this seriously; we’re currently experimenting with a 9/80 work schedule and follow ‘no meeting Wednesdays’ so we can focus and get our work done without dipping into personal time. High coding standards – We are believers in the importance of developer experience and testing for long term success, so our code and processes take advantage of static typing, object-oriented design, and automated testing and deployment. Process where it makes sense – Our organization employs an agile process, but we also understand the importance of the engineering side of software engineering so there are times where we roll up our sleeves and put together documentation and design specifications up front before getting down to the business of writing code. What you bring to Uplight: We are looking for an experienced backend software engineer who brings relevant expertise to the table in a pragmatic and cooperative way. This is a senior role, so you should have a proven track record of successful design and delivery of backend systems. The Essentials Senior level understanding and experience with any relevant programming language in the context of backend development (Python, C#, Java, etc.) An understanding of software engineering fundamentals, and the ability to articulate design trade-offs We’re looking for someone who is curious and interested in working cooperatively on hard problems with a team of talented engineers rather than a specific set of skills. Most of our work will be in Python, but all we expect is knowledge of a modern programming language, an understanding of software development fundamentals, and a willingness to learn and work with Python. Skills and experience are necessary, but we hire on value alignment first, so if you feel you would be a good fit with us, still consider applying. Bonus Points: API, SDK, or developer portal experience where developers were your primary customer Experience with multiple database types and an understanding of data schemas Cloud infrastructure management and dev-ops knowledge Greenfield engineering experience or other experience that required dealing with ambiguity and involved personal and team ownership of solutions Experience with containerization and/or orchestration technology What makes working at Uplight amazing: In addition to all the standard medical and dental benefits, that kick in Day 1, we are: Proud to be over 500+ purpose-driven individuals helping to create a more sustainable planet.

"Growing Engineering Team Looking for Sr. Full-stack Engineer We are a distributed engineering team that has a great deal of respect and interest in new technologies, and are looking for candidates who do too. We mainly use JavaScript technologies like Node on the back-end, and frameworks on the front-end like React, Vue, Ember, or Angular. We’re more interested in your deep understanding of web development and development concepts like code architecture, maintainability, and best practices, than we are if you know a particular framework or technology we are using. While we know how to have fun, our work culture is based around professionalism and respect for each other. As such, we’ve described our ideal candidates as “studio-musician developers” instead of “rock-star developers.” The ability to work and communicate well with a team is critical. If you can stay focused and get work done on a reasonable schedule, that is more important to our team than the ability to soldier through long hours. While every job requires bursts of workload from time to time, we view “crunchtime” as a process failure, not a badge of honor. We work on a variety of projects, but are hiring specifically for a project that uses the following technologies: Node.js Vue.js Salary Range $110,000 - $140,000 We are a side-project friendly engineering company with an IP clause that allows employees to confidently retain ownership over their personal Intellectual Property. Responsibilities Develop software applications using best practices in coordination with a distributed team. Review teammates code (we use pull requests). Help plan & roadmap new features and functionality. Qualifications 5+ years as a professional software engineer. Ability to architect complex software features and functionality in a maintainable, DRY, abstract, and modular way. Ability to design an execution plan for the aforementioned functionality (we use JIRA but an understanding of any task management software is fine). Knowledge of MVC or similar architectural patterns. Expert understanding of JavaScript and asynchronous code. Expert understanding of web development concepts, such as how to write best practices code, various persistence layer technologies (SQL, NoSQL, etc), queues, infrastructure architecture (including cloud based), scaling systems, debugging, tests, version control, a deep understanding of http, etc. Understanding of the full web development stack. You may be better at one end of the stack, but you would be able to develop and deploy a complex web application from the ground up alone if you had to. Ability to work at a steady pace instead of procrastination leading to long hours and burnout. Belief that learning is one of the best properties of the software engineering profession. Ability to communicate and work well with a team (this is critical for the success of our distributed engineering team). Technologies we use and would love to see you have experience with (but we realize the right candidate can learn new technologies quickly anyways) Node.js. React.js, Vue.js, Ember.js, Angular (we’d love you to have experience with at least one newer front-end framework). Postgresql, MySql, MongoDB, Redis. Build tools like Webpack, Grunt, etc. React Native. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform. Docker, Containerization technologies. Any technology you are passionate about and want to share with us! We are an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
