matson et al., 2018; skinnider et al., 2020; and russ and patterson et al., 2020). now, we are ready to launch a new set of projects to tackle our second goal and define how the details of each movement, each specific muscle contraction, are encoded within networks of genetically defined spinal cord neurons. ultimately, we hope to use this knowledge to foster recovery in the context of neurodegenerative diseases of the motor system and following stroke or spinal injury. to do this, we have to develop new scientific approaches to link motor behavior and neural activity. we will perform mouse experiments while collecting high resolution quantitative data from multiple data streams. we will integrate and analyze this data to identify underlying features and relationships, “decode” neural activity, and test how these features change when we alter the activity of specific cell types. we will then build and test models of the neural computations that mediate movement. finally, to fully leverage the power of these large and rich datasets, we will create a cloud-based open data commons to facilitate community-wide exploration and discovery. ward lab data types: proteomics: whole cell proteomics, affinity-purificaiton proteomics, “exotic” proximity labeling and subcellular fractionation proteomics transcriptomics: whole cell and scrnaseq, splicing analysis, “exotic” rnaseq derivatives such as proximity labeling and ribotag functional genomics: crispri/a pooled screens, perturb-seq microscopy: longitudinal microscopy analysis (neuronal survival, neuritic branching), cellprofiler, “exotic” cellpaint ward lab analysis goals: majority effort: the contractor will primarily use existing analysis pipelines, modifying as needed for the desired applications to perform primary analysis interpretation, and visualization of proteomic, transcriptomic, genomic, functional genomic, and microscopy datasets. minority effort: higher-order secondary analysis of above datasets in the context of each-other, e.g. multi-layered analysis of related proteomic, transcriptomic, and functional genomics datasets generated by our lab in the context of larger curated datasets from the community (crisprbrain, czi ncdn, patient genomics, curated scrnaseq datasets) ward lab sow data analysis (as above) the contractor will interpret and communicate results of analysis in written and oral formats to team, and generate accompanying graphical visualizations of data the contractor will generate and maintain an annotated database of all raw and post-analysis data, and work with others within dti to enable sharing of these datasets with the broader research community with portals in development by dti the contractor will work with other team members within dti, as needed, to harmonize data analysis pipelines within the group and among outside groups (e.g. czi) ward lab areas of synergy with ongoing efforts at dti: integrate/refine existing analysis pipelines that dti has built for previous projects, harmonize analysis pipelines with related efforts at card/czi when possible. most of the wet-lab techniques and downstream analytic pipelines are also being developed for/used by indi, so there is the potential for synergy in both directions. leverage and build upon existing relationships between ward lab members, card, lng, and dti.  ward lab background: the ward lab studies cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. we exclusively use genetically-modified human ipscs that harbor disease-related gene mutations or express functionalized transgenes as our cellular model system. ipscs are then differentiated into disease-relevant cell types such as neurons and microglia. almost every experiment in our lab begins with an unbiased ‘omics experiment, ranging from functional genomic screens to proteomics to transcriptomics. our lab is closely affiliated with the ipsc neurodegenerative disease initiative (indi), a large-scale nih initiative that is in the process of generating hundreds of isogenic models of neurodegenerative diseases and related phenotypic datasets. we are also a part of the chan zuckerberg institute neurodegeneration challenge network (ndcn), an international network of who apply innovative, collaborative, and transparent research modalities to tackle these diseases. increasingly, our experimental pipelines generate large multimodal datasets, examining the molecular consequences of a gene perturbation from numerous biological angles. in parallel, we study large sets of causal neurodegeneration-related genes in parallel with high-content ‘omic readouts, which we anticipate will lead to identification of converging molecular pathways. results from these unbiased experiments are then refined into testable models, driving deep mechanistic dives into the underlying biological processes that underlie disease.",data scientist

"axle informatics is a bioinformatics and information technology company that offers innovative computer services, informatics, and enterprise solutions to research centers and healthcare organizations around the globe. with experts in software engineering, bioinformatics and program management, we focus on developing and applying technology tools and techniques to empower decision-making and accelerate the discovery in translational research. we work with some of the top research organizations and facilities in the country including multiple institutes at the national institutes of health (nih). axle is seeking a data scientist for the development of informatics infrastructure that supports the genetic and rare diseases (gard) information center and development of data models to support national center for translational sciences (ncats) office of rare diseases research (ordr)’s rare diseases informatics initiatives. the national institutes of health (nih) is the nation’s leading medical research agency and the primary federal agency whose mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability by supporting and making medical discoveries. ncats is the only center at the nih that focuses exclusively on all aspects of the translation of research with an innovative pipeline of treatment discoveries for all diseases. ncats brings together a diverse group of scientists, including medicinal chemists, biologists, toxicologists, clinicians, and engineers to translate basic science conducted elsewhere into products and services that help improve people’s health and lives. ncats’ mission is to improve health through smarter science that results in better treatments faster for all diseases, rare or common. within that remit, the ncats ordr’s mission is to advance rare disease research to benefit patients. currently, there are about 7,000-10,000 known rare diseases that affect people in the us, yet only a few hundred (less than 5%) have a treatment and even fewer a cure. a rare disease is defined in us law (orphan drug act (oda) of 1983,[1] rare diseases act (rda) of 2002[2]) as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the us. most rare diseases affect far fewer patients than this, with most rare diseases affecting only a few hundreds to thousands of patients. collectively, however, rare diseases are not rare at all, and in total are estimated to affect as many as 25-30 million patients in the us, making rare diseases a large public health consideration. the ordr’s gard information center was established in 2003 under a congressional mandate (rda 2002), and is a federally funded program that has an essential role in the dissemination of public health information to rare disease researchers, clinicians, and patients that is freely accessible to the public. however, obtaining accurate, comprehensive, timely, and objective information on rare diseases is often difficult, given the large number of rare diseases, rapidly evolving science (especially related to genomics), diverse data sources, and inconsistent nomenclature and ontologies for rare disease classification, among other issues. recently, gard has been undergoing a re-envisioning and re-design based on a neo4j knowledge graph database that integrates rare disease data from multiple sources to keep the information on ~6,000 different rare diseases in gard up-to-date and useful to the patient and clinical research communities. research tools, artificial intelligent models, data visualization and informatics infrastructure based on the knowledge graph database will be developed to support rare diseases research and clinical activities, and to answer rare disease research questions likely to inform rare disease research prioritization.

"the organization cna is a non-profit organization dedicated to the safety and security of the nation. we analyze and solve problems by getting as close as possible to the people, the data – and the problems themselves – in order to find the clear, credible answers government leaders need to choose the best course of action.  cna was founded in 1942 when cna analysts pioneered the field of operations research by helping the navy address the german u-boat threat. not content to study the problem from afar, this small group of mit scientists insisted on deploying with navy forces in order to observe operations and collect the data needed for meaningful analyses. their groundbreaking work set a standard for operations research methods that cna has maintained for over 75 years.  today, with more than 500 staff members at our headquarters and another 50 researchers in the field, cna still takes a multi-disciplinary, real-world approach to our work. on-site analysts carefully observe all aspects of a problem—people, decisions, actions, consequences—and then collaborate with a headquarters-based research team to assess data and arrive at findings.  cna’s work is executed through two business units: the center for naval analyses, the department of the navy’s only dedicated federally funded research and development center (ffrdc), and the institute for public research (ipr). the ffrdc supports both the department of the navy (don) and the department of defense (dod), while ipr supports non-defense government organizations such as the department of homeland security, the

high performance computing to obtain insights from big data developing custom analytical simulations using techniques such as continuous time, discrete event, and monte carlo approaches to approximate existing systems to quantify the effects of changes to improve those systems building and deploying dashboards and dynamic decision support tools in the navy’s cloud environments identifying optimal solutions using mathematical programming techniques such as mixed integer programming, network analysis, and linear/non-linear programming. leading and facilitating human centered design workshops to ensure data-driven solutions meet stakeholder requirements and preferences the dsd develops models and analytics to support navy problems across all navy domains, including aviation, surface warfare, undersea warfare, cyber, logistics, readiness, force generation, sustainment, acquisition, and cost modeling. dsd analysts support decision-makers by identifying key drivers of both successful and poor performance to improve navy and marine corps outcomes. the division currently supports the navy’s performance-to-plan forum, which provides senior navy leadership forward looking performance
