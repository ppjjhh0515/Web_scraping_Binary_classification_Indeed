"Software Analyst Apprenticeship Overview Summary Apprenticeship includes two phases: RTI (required technical instruction) and OJT (on-the-job training). RTI prepares apprentices to work productively during OJT. On the job, a software analyst is tasked with maintaining, testing, and updating software products under the supervision of experienced developers, engineers and architects. This role provides more flexibility through a shorter and more focused RTI phase to allow for markets or positions with a lower required experience level, or where specialized training will be a major component of OJT (e.g., embedded systems, cloud services, machine learning), or as a stepping stone to a project or program management career path. Although the apprenticeship will focus on coding, the majority of a software developer’s time is generally not spent writing new applications, especially at the junior level. Instead the focus is on improving existing products and applications by adding features, finding and eliminating bugs, and improving efficiency. Related occupational roles include software developers (a more in-depth version of this role with additional focus on security, distributed systems, and design patterns) and DevOps specialists/network operations developers (who configure the build, test, and deployment environments for developers). RTI Preparation Apprentices generally receive instruction in web fundamentals (2 weeks), JavaScript/Python programming (4 weeks), and additional training in Python, C#, or Java software development (6-8 weeks). This varies by location, training provider availability, and employer requests. A sample training plan follows at the end of this document. We cannot guarantee availability or timing of this exact plan in all markets. Apprentices in this role will not earn certifications, but instead will be evaluated based on the quality of their code submissions or general productivity, as established by the employer. OJT Activities Software analysts generally work on tasks substantially similar to the following during OJT. The exact weight and distribution of these tasks varies by employer and may change over the course of OJT as the apprentice becomes more proficient with advanced tasks. Project Definition o Identify and capture stakeholder requirements using customer interviews and surveys. o Build multiple use cases to describe each action that a user will take in the new system. o Understand and contribute to requirement specification documents. Software Design o Work with stakeholders to understand requirements. o Specify and scope hardware and system requirements. o Identify and mitigate security threats and vulnerabilities that may arise from interactions with other systems, external and legacy code. Development and Implementation o Develop and write software code. o Perform unit testing and fix errors or bugs. Software Testing o Work with development team to create test plans. o Implement test cases. o Find and fix bugs. Deployment and Maintenance o Perform training for end users. o Evaluate and fix bugs that may become apparent after product deployment. Job Type: Full-time COVID-19 considerations: Related Technical Instruction will be remote prior to on-the-job onboarding",software engineer

"Growing Engineering Team Looking for Sr. Full-stack Engineer We are a distributed engineering team that has a great deal of respect and interest in new technologies, and are looking for candidates who do too. We mainly use JavaScript technologies like Node on the back-end, and frameworks on the front-end like React, Vue, Ember, or Angular. We’re more interested in your deep understanding of web development and development concepts like code architecture, maintainability, and best practices, than we are if you know a particular framework or technology we are using. While we know how to have fun, our work culture is based around professionalism and respect for each other. As such, we’ve described our ideal candidates as “studio-musician developers” instead of “rock-star developers.” The ability to work and communicate well with a team is critical. If you can stay focused and get work done on a reasonable schedule, that is more important to our team than the ability to soldier through long hours. While every job requires bursts of workload from time to time, we view “crunchtime” as a process failure, not a badge of honor. We work on a variety of projects, but are hiring specifically for a project that uses the following technologies: Node.js Vue.js Salary Range $110,000 - $140,000 We are a side-project friendly engineering company with an IP clause that allows employees to confidently retain ownership over their personal Intellectual Property. Responsibilities Develop software applications using best practices in coordination with a distributed team. Review teammates code (we use pull requests). Help plan & roadmap new features and functionality. Qualifications 5+ years as a professional software engineer. Ability to architect complex software features and functionality in a maintainable, DRY, abstract, and modular way. Ability to design an execution plan for the aforementioned functionality (we use JIRA but an understanding of any task management software is fine). Knowledge of MVC or similar architectural patterns. Expert understanding of JavaScript and asynchronous code.
